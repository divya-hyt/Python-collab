# Day 2 topics: Data Types, Numbers, Operations, Type conversion, f-strings

# Target: To build a tip calculator

# Data Type 1(DT1): Strings
# Concept of subscripting
print(len("Hello"))
print("Hello"[0]) 
# Get the code to print the last character here
print("Hello"[4])
# int object is not subscriptable

 DT2: Integers: Whole numbers- +ve and -ve
 For large #s, use underscore b/w to improve readability,but system reads as a whole without _ (Eg. 100_456_70 is read as 10045670)
 DT3: Floating point #s: decimal point can float around
 DT4: Boolean: True or False (Capital T and F)

#get a 2-digit number and print sum of it's digits
two_digit_number = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
####################################
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print(type(two_digit_number))
# input() function stores in type- string
a= two_digit_number
sum_of_digits= int(a[0])+int(a[1])
print(sum_of_digits)

# Mathematical Operations
3 + 8
7 - 2
3 * 4
print(type(6 / 3))
# type() returns the data type; Div operator always stores result as float.
# ** denotes "to the power of" or exponential value
print(2 ** 3)


# If operators in same line, priority on the basis of PEMDASLR - Paranthesis, Exponent, Mult, Div, Add, Subt, Left, Right
# Calc goes from left to right, * & / have equal priority
# change the code to get output as 3: print(3*3+3/3-3)
print(3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 )
# another way- using paranthesis to isolate certain calculations
print(3*(3+3)/3-3)

# BMI Calculator: BMI= Weight in kg/ Height^2 in metres
# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

h = float(height)
w = int(weight)
BMI = int(w / h**h)
# Another way: BMI = int(w / (h*h))
print (BMI)

# To round of, use round() function, can specify # of digits to round off
print(round(2.6666,2))

print (8 // 3)
# // this converts division result into int
result = 4 / 2
result /= 2
print (result)
# /=, +=, -=, *= to manipulate a variable based on it's last result

# f-String is used to print diff data types in one print line smoothly
score = 1
height = 1.67
Win = True
print (f"So your score is {score}, height is {height} and your Success status is {Win}")

#  Calculating your Life in Weeks left on planet earth, assuming Max=90
age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
Years_left = 90 - int(age)
Weeks_left = (Years_left * 52)
print(f"You have {Weeks_left} weeks left.")

# Day 2 Final Project: Tip Calculator

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
Bill = float(input ("What was the total bill? Rs."))
Tip = int(input ("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12 or 15 percent?\n "))
Bill_with_tip = Bill + Bill * (Tip/100)
ppl = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
split_bill = round(Bill_with_tip / ppl,2)
print(f"Each person should pay:Rs.{split_bill}")
